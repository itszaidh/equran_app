eQuran brings together Quran reading, ayah and surah audio playback, offline audio downloads, tafsir, transliteration, favourites, and reading progress in a Material 3 Flutter app. The interface is intentionally quiet: useful controls stay close at hand without pulling attention away from the text.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Flutter SDK on the stable channel.
- Git.
- Platform tooling for your target:
  - Android: Android Studio and Android SDK.
  - Linux: `clang`, `cmake`, `ninja-build`, `pkg-config`, `libgtk-3-dev`, plus GStreamer development packages for audio builds.
  - Windows: Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload.

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ya27hw/equran_app.git
cd equran_app
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Run Locally

```bash
flutter run
```

You can also target a specific platform:

```bash
flutter run -d android
flutter run -d linux
flutter run -d windows
flutter run -d chrome
```

## Build

### Android Split APKs

```bash
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

Artifacts are written to:

```text
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
```

### Linux

```bash
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
flutter build linux --release
```

Artifacts are written to:

```text
build/linux/x64/release/bundle/
```

### Windows

```bash
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
flutter build windows --release
```

Artifacts are written to:

```text
build/windows/x64/runner/Release/
```

## Release Flow

The release workflow lives at [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

On pushes to `main` or manual workflow dispatch, the workflow:

1. Reads the version from `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Builds Android split APKs, a Linux release bundle, and a Windows release bundle.
3. Creates a tag from the semantic version, for example `v2.7.3`.
4. Publishes a GitHub Release with generated release notes and build artifacts.

Existing tags are detected before release jobs run, so previously published versions are skipped.
